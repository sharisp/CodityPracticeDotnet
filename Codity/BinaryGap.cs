         1. BinaryGap
Problem:
A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros surrounded by ones in the binary representation of N.
Write a function that returns the length of the longest binary gap of N. If N doesn’t contain a binary gap, return 0.
Example:
N = 529 → binary 1000010001 → longest gap = 4
